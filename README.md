## Development

If you drag the mouse horizontally to the right you will see an increment on the amount of lines. If you drag it to the left side the amount of lines will decrease.

If you drag the mouse vertically to the top the white lines will get thicker. If you drag the mouse vertically to the bottom the white lines will get thinner.
